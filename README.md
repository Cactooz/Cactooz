### Hello there 👋

I'm Hugo, a Swedish High-School student.

aka Cactooz or TheCactusMonkey

- 🗺️ I’m currently working on random projects on my free time, currently a lot of Discord bots and Shell based projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more indepth Shell programming, as well as 3D programming in C#.
- 💾 I code in C#, JS, Python, Shell, Batch as well as HTML and CSS.
- 🤔 I'm always open for tips and tricks :D
- 🔒 Many but not all more repositories are public, many are old tasks, projects or just random testing.
